# Board Game Design Assistant

An app that utilises the [OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/) to provide board game theme, mechanism, rule set and artwork suggestions to help spark creativity and assist in your design process.

You can [view it live here](https://bg-design-assistant.vercel.app/).

## Generation Methods

Users have the option to generate ideas in three ways:

-   **Random**: Generates a random idea chosen by the AI with no additional user input.
-   **Thematic**: Generates a board game idea based on the provided theme. This should return an idea in which the mechanisms suggested match up thematically with the description.
-   **Mechanisms**: Generates a board game idea based on the user input of board game mechanisms, target audience and number of players. This should return and idea in which the theme suggested matches up thematically with the user's chosen mechanisms.

## Future Features

-   Save favourites into localStorage
-   Print / share generated games
-   Add option to regenerated based on an existing game generation
